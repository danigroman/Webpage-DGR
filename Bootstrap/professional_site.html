          My name is Daniela Gonzalez Roman. I studied at NYU Gallatin, where I focused on Cultures of Diplomacy and
          Narratives of Power. This concentration allowed me to explore and analyze cultural practices through
          narrative, aiming to foster more diplomatic and empathetic global relations. I am currently preparing for the
          LSAT.<br><br>
          Throughout my career, I have worked extensively in journalism, holding positions at CNN, BBC Mundo, Americas
          Society, and Latin News. I grew up in a Cuban household in Miami, Florida, and Spanish is my native language.
          Additionally, I was placed in a French program at a young age, which, along with my diverse upbringing,
          exposed me to multiple languages.
