    About me

  <section>
    <h2>My background</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Daniela Gonzalez Roman. I studied at NYU Gallatin, where I focused on Cultures of Diplomacy and Narratives of Power. <br>
      This concentration allowed me to explore and analyze cultural practices through narrative, aiming to foster more diplomatic and empathetic global relations. I am currently preparing for the LSAT.  <br>
      
      Throughout my career, I have worked extensively in journalism, holding positions at CNN, BBC Mundo, Americas Society, and Latin News.  <br>
      I grew up in a Cuban household in Miami, Florida, and Spanish is my native language.  <br>
      Additionally, I was placed in a French program at a young age, which, along with my diverse upbringing, exposed me to multiple languages. <br>
