        <h2>My Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          I am very close to my mother, Ingrid, and have been working with her for the past year. <br>
          I was born when she was very young, and many of the experiences I've had are thanks to her support. <br>
          She immigrated just before her college years, yet managed to earn a scholarship and, while pregnant, completed
          her bachelor's, master's, doctorate, and second master's degree. <br>
          She is a strong influence in my life and my greatest support. <br>
          My decision to enroll at NYU was partly inspired by her teenage dream of attending that university, a dream
          that influenced me from a young age. <br>
