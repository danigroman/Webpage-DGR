        <h2>My background</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Daniela Gonzalez Roman. I studied at NYU Gallatin, where I focused on Cultures of Diplomacy and
          Narratives of Power. <br>
          This concentration allowed me to explore and analyze cultural practices through narrative, aiming to foster
          more diplomatic and empathetic global relations. I am currently preparing for the LSAT. <br>

          Throughout my career, I have worked extensively in journalism, holding positions at CNN, BBC Mundo, Americas
          Society, and Latin News. <br>
          I grew up in a Cuban household in Miami, Florida, and Spanish is my native language. <br>
          Additionally, I was placed in a French program at a young age, which, along with my diverse upbringing,
          exposed me to multiple languages. <br>

      <section id="my_interests" class="column2">
        <h2>My interests</h2>
        <p>
          My interests include watching and reviewing movies, exploring global histories through primary sources, <br>
          with a particular focus on the Middle East and Latin America, and reading autobiographies, especially those of
          wartime journalists. <br>
          Additionally, I am quite active in meditation and Pilates. <br>
